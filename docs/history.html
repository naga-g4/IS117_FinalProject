      Find out the very beginning of the internet, how it was conceptualized and built:

        In the year 1958 during the height of the cold war, the Soviets launched Sputnik,
        the first aircraft in space. The United States government realized the advanced technology
        the Soviets were capable of building so they created and funded a program known as ARPA
        (Advanced Research Projects Agency). The reason for this program was initially for the purpose
        of defense. This varied from ballistic missile detection to improving communication.
        Communication not just in case of nuclear attack, but communication between people,
        more specifically scientists and researchers who want to share ideas. In the late 1950s,
        communication still depended on circuit switching and telephones which was very primitive.
      </p>
      <p>
        In 1962, J.C.R Licklider comes up with the basic concept of a network, the modern day internet we
        have today, in his memos titled The Intergalactic Network. ARPA followed these guidelines in their
        mission to create a network that has the ability to connect multiple people at the same time for
        communication automatically at any given time. Paul Baron researched an efficient way to transport
        information from one point to another, called packet switching. Packet switching is the basis of
        network communication because of the ability to send information to a shared network.
        In January of 1967, Larry Roberts was hired as the project manager of ARPANET. Roberts implemented
        the ideas of Licklider and the packet switching theory with the intention of creating a network.
        But first, there needed to be a way to connect computers together, so one computer can communicate
        with another computer. In the late 1960s, BBN Technologies created IMP’s (Interface Message Processor).
        These IMP’s would connect the computers together.
      </p>
      <p>
        In September of 1969,  The first node was created when Lenord Kleinrock connected a computer at UCLA
        to an IMP. Soon after, another node was established, this time at Stanford. In October, a message
        was successfully sent from UCLA to Stanford using packet switching. This marked the very first-time
        information was shared using the ARPANET.
      </p>
      <p>
        The ARPANET really began to take off after Bob Khan and Vinton Cerf under DARPA (ARPA was renamed to
        DARPA or  Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency), reformulated the ARPANET from NCP
        (Network Control Protocol) to TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) and IP (Internet Protocol).
        NCP was basically the transport layer. NCP would be used to connect one computer on the ARPANET
        to another for sending information such as emails. TCP/IP protocol is used in the modern day internet
        and it replaced NCP in 1980.
      </p>

        From there on, the internet expanded more and more and soon web browsers were available so that the
        everyday person can also access the internet.
