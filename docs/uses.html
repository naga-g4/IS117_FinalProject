      <h4>Communication</h4>
      <p class="text-muted"> One of the biggest impacts that the internet has had on the world is
      that improved communication greatly. The internet is used by billions around the globe to talk to
      one and other. Forms of internet communication range from emails, which was one of the initial uses
      of the internet in its early days, to social media (Facebook, Twitter, Instagram). Allowing a user to
      instanly, in real time, talk to another users that could be thousands of miles away. </p>

  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-md-6">
      <h4>Information</h4>
      <p class="text-muted">Also one of the initial reasons to create the internet was to share ideas and
      information. For example, when a user does not understand a math problem or needs the history of World War 2
      for an essay, they can turn to the internet to research the information they require. Other users post
      this information and make it available to the public so those who need it can use it. The internet
      and its many users have posted a mass amount of information from a list of the smallest islands in the world
      to what string theory is. The internet also spreads news about whats going on around the world.</p>

      <h4>Make Life Easier</h4>
      <p class="text-muted">The internet simply makes many facets of easier. For example, online shopping has
        become popular so that people do not have to physically go to a store to buy and shopping on Ebay and
        Craigslist for cheaper than retail and unique items. Apart from that, being able to google anything
      and getting answer, and talking to anyone, anywhere, at anytime, the internet enables a user to order
        groceries, work a job from their home and much more.

      <h4>Entertainment</h4>
      <p class="text-muted">Radio preceded cable television and now the internet is starting to take over. The
        internet made it possible for websites like Netflix, and Youtube to work. The internet enables users the
        capability to watch almost anything they desire at anytime. Online games too are really popular
      and having the ability to play with real people online makes that much more entertaining.</p>
