    In the year 1958 during the height of the cold war, the Soviets launched Sputnik, the first aircraft in space. The United States government realized the advanced technology the Soviets were capable of building so they created and funded a program known as ARPA (Advanced Research Projects Agency). The reason for this program was initially for the purpose of defense. This varied from ballistic missile detection to improving communication. Communication not just in case of nuclear attack, but communication between people, more specifically scientists and researchers who want to share ideas. In the late 1950s, communication still depended on circuit switching and telephones, however, this was a very primitive version of the telephone communication we have today. The caller would be answered by an operator who would ask for the number the caller was trying to reach, the operator then manually connects the caller to the receiver. This was a huge problem as communication was linear,  only two distinct locations can communicate at any one time, and if the line was to malfunction and disconnect during the call, the call had to be made all over again. So, the United States found it absolutely necessary to create a better communication method for the safety of the nation. In 1962, J.C.R Licklider comes up with the basic concept of a network, the modern day internet we have today, in his memos titled The Intergalactic Network. ARPA followed these guidelines in their mission to
